          AGS Formule 1 (Automobiles Gonfaronnaises Sportives) took part in the
          Formula 1 World Championships from 86 to 92, thanks to its founder
          Henri Julien. After these participations, he developed the concept of
          Formula 1 training courses. This was AGS&apos;s main activity for many
          years.
        </p>

        <p className="text-center">
          The unique facilities of this former racing team based on the CÃ´te
          d&apos;Azur, and private access to the Var circuit, make it an exceptional
          setting for any motor sport activity.

          At the beginning of 2019, Willy Collignon, owner and manager of the
          First Motorsport stable, was looking for a second workshop in the
          south of France. After a long search, he ended up in Gonfaron... As
          soon as he entered the AGS facilities, he noticed the incredible
          potential of the team. He decided to invest in its development.
        </p>

        <p className="text-center">
          Since August 2019, Willy has been at the helm of the team. His goal?
          To give AGS a fresh start and bring competition back to the workshop!
        </p>

        <p className="text-center">
          He also wants to revive the history of AGS: we are rebuilding the
          historic vehicles that raced in the World Championship. Tarquini&apos;s
          JH25 and 24 have already taken to the track for the first time
        </p>
